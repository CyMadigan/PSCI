function Build-MsBuildPackage {
     <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Builds a MsBuild package, i.e. a package that contains output of msbuild compilation (for e.g. console or library projects).

    .DESCRIPTION
    $ProjectPath is compiled and packaged using msbuild to the $OutputPath (or $PackagesPath\$PackageName if $OutputPath is not provided).
    It also writes version number to AssemblyInfo files.

    .PARAMETER PackageName
    Name of the package. It determines OutputPath if it's not provided.

    .PARAMETER ProjectPath
    Path to the project file that will be compiled and packaged. It can be a msbuild solution or project.

    .PARAMETER OutputPath
    Output path where the package will be created. If not provided, $OutputPath = $PackagesPath\$PackageName, where $PackagesPath is taken from global variable.

    .PARAMETER RestoreNuGet
    If true, 'nuget restore' will be explicitly run before building the project file.

    .PARAMETER MsBuildOptions
    An object created by New-MsBuildOptions function, which specifies msbuild options.
    If not provided, default msbuild options will be used.

    .PARAMETER Version
    Version number which will be written to the AssemblyInfo files.

    .PARAMETER AssemblyInfoFilePaths
    Paths to AssemblyInfo files which will have their version numbers updated.

    .LINK

    .EXAMPLE
    Build-MsBuildPackage -PackageName 'MyProject' -ProjectPath 'Src\MyProject.sln'
