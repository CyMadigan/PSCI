    Returns path to the generated .MOF file if StepName is a DSC configuration or empty string if it's a function.

    .PARAMETER StepName
    Name of the DSC configuration or function to invoke.

    .PARAMETER StepScriptBlockResolved
    Resolved step scriptblock (see [[Resolve-StepScriptBlock]]).

    .PARAMETER Node
    Name of the node - will be passed as 'NodeName' to the configuration.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Environment name - will be passed as 'Environment' to the configuration.

    .PARAMETER ServerRole
    Server role name - will be passed as 'ServerRole' to the configuration.

    .PARAMETER ResolvedTokens
    Tokens resolved for the node/environment - will be passed as 'Tokens' to the configuration.

    .PARAMETER ConnectionParams
    Connection parameters as defined in server roles (object created by [[New-ConnectionParameters]]).

    .EXAMPLE
    $mofDir = Invoke-DeploymentStep -StepName $StepName -OutputPath $DscOutputPath -Node $Node -Environment $Environment -ResolvedTokens $resolvedTokens
