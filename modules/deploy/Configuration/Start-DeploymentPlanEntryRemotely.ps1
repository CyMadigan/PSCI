function Start-DeploymentPlanEntryRemotely {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Runs the actual deployment basing on the deployment plan on a remote server.

    .PARAMETER DeploymentPlanEntry
    Deployment plan entry to deploy.

    .PARAMETER PackageCopiedToNodes
    Defines array with node names where the package was already copied to.

    .PARAMETER DeployType
    Deployment type:
    All       - deploy everything according to configuration files (= Provision + Deploy)
    Provision - deploy only DSC configurations
    Deploy    - deploy only non-DSC configurations
    Adhoc     - override configurations and nodes with $ConfigurationsFilter and $NodesFilter (they don't have to be defined in ServerRoles - useful for adhoc deployments)

    .EXAMPLE
    Start-DeploymentPlanEntryRemotely -DeploymentPlan $Global:DeploymentPlan -Environment $Environment -CopyPackage
