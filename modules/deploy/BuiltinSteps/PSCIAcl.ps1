configuration PSCIAcl {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Ensures specific directories has specific Access Control Lists.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This is DSC configuration, so it should be invoked locally (but can also be invoked with -RunRemotely).
    It uses following tokens:
    - **DirectoryAcls** - hashtable (or array of hashtables) with following keys:
      - **Path** - (required) path to directory
      - **Account** - (required) account name that will be allowed/denied to the directory
      - **Access** - Allow (default) or Deny
      - **Rights** - FullControl, Modify or ReadAndExecute (default)
      - **Inherit** - ACL inheritance (default true)
      - **Strict** - whether to use strict account name checking (default false)
    
    See also [Grani_ACL](https://github.com/guitarrapc/DSCResources/tree/master/Custom/GraniResource/DSCResources/Grani_ACL).
