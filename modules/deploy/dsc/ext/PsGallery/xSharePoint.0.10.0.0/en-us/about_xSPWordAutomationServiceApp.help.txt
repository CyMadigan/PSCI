DESCRIPTION 

The resource is able to provision, unprovision and configure the Word Automation Service Application.
All settings that you can configure on the Service Application administration page are configurable using this resource.

Important:
When you specify Ensure=Present, the Application Pool and DatabaseName parameters are required.
When you specify Ensure=Absent, no other parameters are allowed (with the exception of Name, InstallAccount or PsDscRunAsCredential).

EXAMPLE

Make sure the service application exists and has a specific configuration

    xSPWordAutomationServiceApp Word Automation 
    { 
        Name = "Word Automation Service Application" 
        Ensure = "Present"
        ApplicationPool = "SharePoint Web Services"
        DatabaseName = "WordAutomation_DB"
        DatabaseServer = "SQLServer"
        SupportedFileFormats = "docx", "doc", "mht", "rtf", "xml"
        DisableEmbeddedFonts = $false
        MaximumMemoryUsage = 100
        RecycleThreshold = 100
        DisableBinaryFileScan = $false
        ConversionProcesses = 8
        JobConversionFrequency = 15                         (in minutes)
        NumberOfConversionsPerProcess = 12
        TimeBeforeConversionIsMonitored = 5                 (in minutes)
        MaximumConversionAttempts = 2
        MaximumSyncConversionRequests = 25 
        KeepAliveTimeout = 30                               (in seconds)
        MaximumConversionTime = 300                         (in seconds)
        PsDscRunAsCredential = $InstallAccount 
    } 

Make sure the service application does not exist and remove when it does

    xSPWordAutomationServiceApp Word Automation 
    { 
        Name = "Word Automation Service Application" 
        Ensure = "Absent"
        PsDscRunAsCredential = $InstallAccount 
    }
