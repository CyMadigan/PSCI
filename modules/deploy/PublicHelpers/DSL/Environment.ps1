function Environment {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Element of configuration DSL used to define environment context for 'Tokens' or 'ServerRole' elements.

    .PARAMETER Name
    Name of the environment.

    .PARAMETER BasedOn
    Indicates base environment to inherit tokens or server roles

    .PARAMETER Definition
    A script block that contains 'Tokens' and 'ServerRole' invocations.

    .EXAMPLE
    ```
    Environment Default {
        Tokens Category1 @{
            ADConnectionString = 'LDAP://IP:389/OU=User'
            DatabaseConnectionString = 'Server=${Node};Database=YourDB;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True'
        }
    }
    Environment Local {
        ServerRole WebServer -Steps @('WebServerProvision', 'WebServerDeploy') -Nodes localhost
    }
    Environment Tests -BasedOn Local {
        ServerRole WebServer -Nodes 'testNode'
    }
