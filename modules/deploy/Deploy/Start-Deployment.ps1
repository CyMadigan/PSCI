function Start-Deployment {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Starts the actual deployment basing on the configuration files. This is an entry point for the project-specific deployment script.

    .DESCRIPTION
    It does the following steps:
    1. Loads configuration files containing environments and tokens to global variable $Environments.
    2. Creates a deployment plan basing on $Environments and parameters passed to this function. 
       Each node gets its own resolved tokens. The deployment plan can be accessed by querying $Global:DeploymentPlan variable.
    3. Runs the deployment plan by deploying configurations node by node.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Name of the environment where the packages will be deployed.

    .PARAMETER ServerRolesFilter
    List of ServerRoles to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all server roles defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, all server roles will be deployed.

    .PARAMETER ConfigurationsFilter
    List of Configurations to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all configurations defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, configurations will be deployed according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER NodesFilter
    List of Nodes where configurations have to be deployed - can be used if you don't want to deploy to all nodes defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, configurations will be deployed to all nodes according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER ValidateOnly
    If set, configuration files will be loaded and deployment plan created, but no actual deployment will run.
    You can use it to validate global hashtables $Tokens, $ServerRoles and $DeploymentPlan.

    .PARAMETER AutoInstallDscResources
    If true (default), custom DSC resources included in PSCI will be automatically copied to localhost (required for parsing DSC configurations)
    and to the destination servers (required for running DSC configurations).

    .PARAMETER DscForce
    If true (default), '-Force' parameter will be passed to 'Start-DscConfiguration'. It is required e.g. when last attempt failed and is still running.

    .PARAMETER TokensOverride
    A list of tokens to override. Token defined in the configuration files will be overrided with values specified in this array 
    (tokens will be matched by name, ignoring categories).

    .PARAMETER DeployType
    Deployment type:
    All       - deploy everything according to configuration files (= Provision + Deploy)
    Provision - deploy only DSC configurations
    Deploy    - deploy only non-DSC configurations
    Adhoc     - override configurations and nodes with $ConfigurationsFilter and $NodesFilter (they don't have to be defined in ServerRoles - useful for adhoc deployments)
