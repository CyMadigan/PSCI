function Get-Hash {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Calculates a single hash value for a list of paths.

    .DESCRIPTION
    It calculates a single hash from concatenated list of file names and hash calculated from every file's contents.
    Supports both files and directories.

    .PARAMETER Path
    Path of the directory to traverse.

    .PARAMETER Exclude
    Exclude mask.

    .PARAMETER Algorithm
    Algorithm to use.   

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-Hash -Path 'c:\test'
