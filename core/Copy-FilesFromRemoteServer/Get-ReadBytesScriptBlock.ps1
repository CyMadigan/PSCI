function Get-ReadBytesScriptBlock {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns a scriptblock that reads specified block of file. This is a helper for Copy-FilesFromRemoteServer / Get-RemoteFileUsingStream.

    .EXAMPLE
        $readBytesRemoteScript = Get-ReadBytesScriptBlock
    #>
    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([scriptblock])]
    param()

    return {
        param($srcFile, $offset)
        
        # Convert the destination path to a full filesystem path (to support relative paths)
        $srcFile = $executionContext.SessionState.Path.GetUnresolvedProviderPathFromPSPath($srcFile)

        # If we convert it to string (in a safe way), and then convert it back to byte[] on the receiving side, performance is much better.
